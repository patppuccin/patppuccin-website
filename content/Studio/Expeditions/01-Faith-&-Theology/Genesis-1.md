# Genesis 1


### 🧾 **What is Genesis?**

Genesis is the very first book of the Bible and it means “beginning.” It’s not written like a science manual, but rather as a meaningful story that tells us about who created the world, why He did it, and what that says about us. It introduces us to a God who is purposeful, creative, and good — and it explains where we came from, why life matters, and how the human story began. It sets the stage for everything else that happens in the Bible.

### ⚖️ **Is Genesis an Exact Telling or a Spiritual Account?**

Genesis gives us truth, but not in the form of a timeline or textbook. It’s not meant to answer scientific questions like when the dinosaurs lived or how atoms formed. Instead, it tells us **who** created the universe and **why** — not every detail of **how**. It uses poetic structure and ancient storytelling to reveal God’s power, order, and care. Genesis is true, but its truth is theological and moral, not just mechanical.

### 🏛️ **Historical Significance and Timeline**

The events described in Genesis, especially in the first 11 chapters, go way back before written history. Scholars estimate that the patriarchs — Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — lived around 2000–1500 BCE. Genesis was likely written or compiled later, around the time of the Exodus. Even though the timeline isn’t exact, the story preserves key truths that shaped the identity of the Israelites and still shape our faith today.

### ✍️ **Who Wrote Genesis?**

Traditionally, Genesis is attributed to Moses, who is also credited with writing the first five books of the Bible (the Torah). While he may have gathered stories passed down orally or from early family records, it’s believed that God guided him to write and compile Genesis as part of revealing His story to Israel. Regardless of the process, the authorship points to a prophetic voice shaping the text with divine purpose.

### 🗣️ **Meaning of the Word “Genesis”**

The name _Genesis_ comes from the Greek word meaning “origin” or “birth.” In Hebrew, it’s called _Bereshith_, which means “In the beginning…” — the very first words of the book. The name itself shows what the book is about: the beginning of everything — the world, human beings, relationships, sin, and God’s plan to redeem it all.

### 📜 **Where Our Genesis Text Comes From**

The text of Genesis we read today comes from ancient Hebrew manuscripts carefully copied and preserved by Jewish scribes (the Masoretes). We also have older fragments like the Dead Sea Scrolls and early Greek translations called the Septuagint. Modern Bible translations like ESV and NKJV are based on the best of these manuscripts, ensuring we read what is very close to the original inspired text.


### 🧠 **Facts and Trivia About Genesis**

Genesis is packed with “firsts”: the first words of God (“Let there be light”), the first marriage, the first sin, and the first promise of redemption. The word “create” is used only with God — no human is ever said to “create” in the same way. The chapter structures are rhythmic and poetic, showing how deeply intentional the writing is. Genesis is referenced all over the Bible — even Jesus quotes it — proving its foundational importance.

### 🔍 **How Genesis Differs from Other Creation Stories**

Many ancient cultures had creation myths involving violent gods or chaotic beginnings. Genesis stands out because it portrays creation as orderly, peaceful, and intentional — made by a single, good God. Humans aren’t an afterthought or slaves in the story, but image-bearers of God, made to reflect His nature. That’s radically different from the chaotic myths of Egypt or Babylon, and it reveals God's heart for people.

### 💡 **Why Genesis Still Matters Today**

Genesis helps us understand who we are: not random accidents, but people made with purpose by a loving Creator. It affirms our worth, our role in creation, and our need for redemption. In a noisy world that often feels confused and chaotic, Genesis reminds us that God brings order out of chaos — and that He calls what He made “good.” It lays a foundation for hope, identity, and faith.

9. What does "dominion" mean to you in the context of how we steward what we’ve been given?
10. How can we bring more intentional “rest” into our week like God did on Day 7?
11. Where in our life do you think we need to speak God's truth over _“formless and void”_ areas?
12. How can we become more aware of God’s presence in the natural world around us?
