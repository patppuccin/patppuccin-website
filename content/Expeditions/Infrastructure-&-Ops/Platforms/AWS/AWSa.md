# Amazon Web Services

**Amazon Web Services** is a broad set of global services that offers cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools on-demand, available in seconds and in a pay-as-you-go basis. AWS was *launched in 2006* and is currently the leading [Cloud Service Provider](/Cloud%20Service%20Provider).

## Six Advantages to AWS Cloud

- **Trade capital expense for variable expense** - Pay-on-demand instead of paying upfront for data centers and servers.
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale** - Sharing the cost of usage with a lot of users reduces the cost per user.
- **Stop guessing capacity** - Scale up or down to meet the requirements instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers.
- **Increase speed and agility** - Launch resources within minutes instead of waiting days or months for IT to implement the solution on-premises.
- **Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers** - Focus on customers instead of operations like racking, stacking and powering servers.
- **Go global in minutes** - Deploy the app in multiple regions of the globe with a few clicks and provide a low latency and better experience for the users.

## Interacting with AWS

All connects to and between the AWS resources are done via API calls and each call needs to be [authenticated](/Authentication) and [authorized](/Authorization). An API is a software that allows two applications or servers to talk to each other. The most common type of API is via the HTTP/HTTPS requests. AWS API is a HTTP API and can be interacted via sending HTTPS requests.  There are 3 ways to connect to the AWS API
1. [AWS Management Console](/AWS%20Management%20Console) - Web-based point and click interface to interact with the AWS resources. More information found on at [working with the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/getting-started.html)
2. [AWS Command Line Interface](../../../../../AWS%20Command%20Line%20Interface.md) - A CLI based console with a fixed syntax to interact with AWS resource to allow scripting and automation. More information at [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
3. [AWS Software Development Kits](../../../../../AWS%20Tools%20and%20SDKs.md) - SDKs for some of the most popular programming languages, allow for programmatical connection to the AWS resources. More information at [tools to Build on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)

## AWS Products and Services

AWS constantly tests and releases new [products and services](../../../../../AWS%20Products%20&%20Services.md) across many technologies and use cases. Almost all new products when released are available only in the `us-east-1` region and offered to other regions gradually. 

AWS currently offers services in the following categories

## Sustainability

AWS aims to go net zero carbon by 2040. Read more about AWS's role in a sustainable global infrastructure from the [Amazon sustainability page](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/).

AWS's sustainability goals are composed of 3 parts
1. **Use Renewable Energy** - AWS aims to use 100% renewable energy by 2025.
2. **Cloud Efficiency** - Making the infrastructure energy efficient.
3. **Water Stewardship** - Usage of non-potable water and direct evaporative cooling systems to cool the data centers. Usage of onsite water treatment facilities to remove scale forming minerals and reuse water multiple times. Monitor water efficiency metrics

## AWS Architectural Diagrams

Architectural diagrams help visualize systems deployed or to be deployed in AWS. [AWS provides assets](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/) for the same and they are available in several third party diagramming tools as well.
