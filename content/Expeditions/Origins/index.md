# What is IT?

Information Technology or IT has transformed lives in a way that may not even realize. Thanks to IT, we can communicate massive amounts of data to people and organizations across the world in the blink of an eye. Computers power everything from calculators to medical equipment, to complex satellite systems to the trading desk of Wall Street. They are so powerful and invaluable tools that enable people to get their work done and and connect with one another.

> IT is the use of digital technology, like computers and the internet to store and process data into useful information.

The IT industry refers to the entire scope of all the jobs and resources that are related to computing technologies. IT is about solving problems in the digital world in the fields of education, medicine, journalism, construction, transportation, entertainment, and any other industry. 

There is a growing skills gap between people who are accustomed to IT and the ones who have moderate to less exposure to it. This gap is called the **`Digital Divide`**. It is with the help of the IT personnel, the gap is managed and bridged. By getting into IT, one can aid and even inspire others to help bridge this digital divide.

### Role of an IT Support Specialist

In general, IT support personnel make sure that an organization's technological infrastructure is running smoothly. This includes **managing**, **installing**, **maintaining**, **troubleshooting**, and **configuring** office and computing equipment. 

### Course Introduction

Computers are everywhere, and by taking this course, it will be possible for the learner to know the working of a computer and get a grasp on the building blocks of IT, basics of how computer hardware performs calculations, the way Operating Systems control and interact with hardware, internet and the understanding of how computers talk to each other, the way applications and programs tie all of this together and allow humans to interact with them. Finally, problem-solving with computer and essential communication skills in IT is dealt with. 

### History of Computing - From Abacus to Artificial Intelligence

A **`computer`** is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations. Historically, the term computer used to refer to someone who actually did the calculations. This course deals with how these calculations are used and baked into applications such as social media or games.

The following section discusses the **`history of computers`** and the journey they took to be that they are today. It is always a good idea to learn about the past (applies to science and philosophy) in order to appreciate the journey and to be inspired about future possibilities. It also gives a sense of why things are the way they are today.

`500 BC`: In China, the abacus was invented. It was popularized during the Ming dynasty (1368 AD to 1644 AD) and has been a very popular calculating device ever since. The abacus is still in use today.

**`1642`**: In France, [Blaise Pascal](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blaise-Pascal) invented the mechanical calculator, called the Arithmetic Machine. It could only do Addition and Subtraction with numbers entered by manipulating its dials

`1801`: In France, [Joseph Marie Jacquard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Marie-Jacquard) invents a loom that uses punched wooden cards to automatically weave fabric designs. These cards were known as punch cards and early computers would use similar punch cards.

`1822`: English mathematician Charles Babbage conceives of a steam-driven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables of numbers. He first designed and built the [Difference Engine](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Difference-Engine) and then designed the [Analytical Engine](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Analytical-Engine), which is considered as the first computer. The analytical engine lacked funding and was never built.

**`1842`**: English Mathematician Ada Lovelace writes the world's first program, an algorithm for the theoretical Analytical Engine. She is considered as the world's first programmer.

An **`Algorithm`** is a series of steps that solve a specific set of problems. 

`1890`: Herman Hollerith designs a punch card system to calculate the 1880 census, accomplishing the task in just three years and saving the government $5 million. He establishes a company that would ultimately become IBM.

Back in the day, computing was expensive. The electronic components powering the computers were large and expensive and took up a lot of space and money to compute anything of value. When the war broke out (WWII), Governments started pouring money into computer research and this led to major breakthroughs and advancements in the field of computing.  

`1936`: [Alan Turing](https://www.livescience.com/29483-alan-turing.html) presents the notion of a universal machine, later called the Turing machine, capable of computing anything that is computable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on his ideas.

### Computer Language

At its core, a computer compares 0s and 1s a million or billion times a second. The communication that a computer uses is referred to as a **`Binary System`** or **`Base-2 Numeral System`**. Instead of the alphabets that human language uses, a computer uses just 0s and 1s to communicate. 

Binary is grouped into 8 numbers called **`bits`** or **`Binary Digit`**. 8 bits equal to a **`Byte`**. Each byte can store one character, thus giving 256 possible characters, as $**2^8=256$.** This byte can refer to anything on a computer, a video, text, games, everything is made up of bytes of information.

### Character Encoding

Thus, taking into consideration that there are 256 possible characters, **`character encoding`** makes it possible to display all characters, emojis, and other language symbols. It is used to assign binary values to characters so that humans can read them. Character encoding is kind of like a dictionary for the computer to look up and decide which human-readable character to show to the user.

The oldest character encoding standard used is [**`ASCII`**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) for **`American Standard Code`** for **`Information Interchange`**. It represents the English alphabet characters, numbers, and punctuation marks. ASCII only used 127 characters out of the 256 possible values and lasted for a very long time, but eventually wasn't enough to support all languages and their symbols. Check out the ASCII table here, 🔗[ASCII Values](http://www.asciitable.com/)

[ASCII to Binary, Octal, Decimal and Hexadecimal Conversion Chart](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d2aa7e7e-77bc-43d4-8382-c98ea0886093/ASCII_to_Binary_Hexadecimal_Octal_-_Sheet1.pdf)

***Conversion chart for the ASCII values***

To rectify the limitations of the ASCII encoding, came the UTF-8 which is the most prevalent encoding standard used today. It has the same values as from the ASCII as well as support for multiple languages and emojis. This is accomplished by using a variable number of bytes. UTF-8 is based on the [Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/standard/standard.html) which helps to represent characters in a consistent manner. 

In computers, RGB color model is used and three characters are used to represent a color. Each character represents the shade of the color which then changes the color of the pixel on the screen. Thus with just 8 combinations of 0s and 1s, everything visual can be represented.

### Binary

The 0s and 1s are nothing but the state of ON or OFF of a circuit. In correspondence with Jacquard's Loom, a 0 would be a NO HOLE and 1 would be a HOLE. If the loom would reach a hole it would thread underneath and if there is no hole, it would not. Using this, complex patterns were weaved. This is foundational Binary concept, with ONs and OFFs. Binary in today's computers are done by electricity. If there is voltage, it is ON, and if there isn't one, it is OFF. This is done via transistors.

Logic gates allow the transistors to do more complex tasks as to where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions. There are a lot of different types of Logic Gates. To read more on Logic Gates, click here 🔗[Logic Gates](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate)

### Counting in Binary

Binary is the fundamental communication block of a computer. It is how the computers count, but humans don't count like that. Children would be taught to count by fingers (hand). Counting by hand is called as the **`Decimal System`** or the **`Base-10 System`**. This system uses 10 possible numbers ranging from 0 - 9. In a binary system, there are only two possible numbers, namely 0s and 1s. These are converted into a system that can be understandable by humans, which is decimal. It is possible to represent any number using bits (binary digits) and invariably represented as a decimal.

![Google_IT_Support_Fundamentals_-_Counting_in_Binary.png](https://patppuccin-assets.r2.cloudflare.com/Google_IT_Support_Fundamentals_-_Counting_in_Binary.png)

This is the basics of how the computer converts the binary code to human-readable characters using a decimal value. the character encoding systems allow the computer to represent the appropriate values for their binary equivalents.

### Abstraction

Humans interact with a computer using a mouse, keyboard, and/or touch screens and do not directly tell the exact 1s and 0s to the machine in order for it to perform calculations. This is done behind the scenes by the concept called **`Abstraction*`**, which is where a relatively complex system is simplified for end-user.

****The process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in the study of objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance; it is similar in nature to the process of generalization***

For example, in case of driving a car, there is no need for the driver to know how to operate the engine and transmission directly, instead it is enough to know the pedals and steering wheels and their working. No matter if the car was made from Volkswagen or BMW or Honda, these elements remain fairly the same. This is abstraction in action. 

Abstraction hides complexity by providing a common interface. In case of a computer, it is not required to know the details of how the computer is operated under the hood. There is mouse, keyboard and/or a touch screen which is all that is required to operate and interact the computer.

Yet another example of abstraction, particularly in the IT world is the concept of ERROR MESSAGES. A simple error message contains the necessary information that would help to get a lead in troubleshooting the issue, rather than requiring to manually surf through the system to find the problem. This saves a lot of time and puts the person who is troubleshooting the issue, closer to the solution.

### Computer Architecture Overview

As an IT support personnel to know and understand the layers of the computer and how they work in unison. This would be tremendously helpful in resolving any issues that arise. 

Computer can be cut into four main layers, and they are
