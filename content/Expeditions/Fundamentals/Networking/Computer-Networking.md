# Computer Networking 

The internet is an electronic communications network that connects computer networks and organizational computer facilities around the world - Merriam Webster 

## Working of the Internet

Internet is basically a long piece of wire that connects the computers so that they can talk to each other. there can be two types of computers in this system. The computer that contains the information that can be shared is called a [Server](/Server) and the computer that requests the information is called a [Client](/Client). A [Client](/Client) can be a [Server](/Server) and a [Server](/Server) can be a [Client](/Client) based on the operations they perform. But servers are usually specialized to serve large amounts of data to numerous computers at the same time by use of specialized hardware. [Servers](/Server) usually run 24/7 ready to serve the content at a moment's notice. 

There are a lot of [servers](/Server) around the world and to locate the required server that the client needs access to, the following flow is used. 

When a site is requested, a message is sent to the [Internet Service Provider](/Internet%20Service%20Provider) stating the website to be visited. The [ISP](/Internet%20Service%20Provider) then relays the message to the [Domain Name System](../../../../Domain%20Name%20System.md) server. The [DNS](../../../../Domain%20Name%20System.md) is basically a address book, as it looks up the [IP](/Internet%20Protocol) address of the website that was requested. This [IP](/Internet%20Protocol) is unique. The [IP](/Internet%20Protocol) address is then relayed back to the [IP](/Internet%20Service%20Provider) and then back to the [Client](/Client). Now the [Client](/Client) makes a direct request to the server via the *Backbone of the Internet* which is the series of cables that connect each and every computer across the world. To visualize the underwater cables that form the backbone of the internet, visit [Submarine Cable Map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/) website.

When the [server](/Server) receives this request from the [client](/Client), it responds with the required requested information, which is relayed back to the [client](/Client) and is displayed to the [client](/Client).
