# Principle of Least Privilege

**Principle if Least Privilege** or **POLP** is a security concept in IT of providing a user, role or application the least amount of permissions to perform an operations or action.

Some of the ways POLP can be enforced are

1. **Just-Enough-Access** or **JEA** - Permits only the actions that needs to be performed.
2. **Just-In-Time** or **JIT** - Permits the smallest length of duration that a role or user can use a permission.

# Risk-based adaptive policies

In **risk-based adaptive policies**, each attempt to access a resource generates a risk score of how likely the request is to be from a compromised source. The risk score could be based on many factors such as device, user location, IP address, the resource being used and so on.
