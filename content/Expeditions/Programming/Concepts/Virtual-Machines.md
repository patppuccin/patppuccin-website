# Virtual Machines (VMs)

A **Virtual Machine** or **VM** is an emulation of a physical computer using software. Server virtualization allows to easily create, copy, resize or migrate the server. Multiple VMs can run on the same physical server, so that the cost of operation can be shared by the multiple users utilizing them. When a virtual machine is launched, it is called as an **instance**.
