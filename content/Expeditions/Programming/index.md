title: Programming
description: Programming & Paradigms explores how code is written, structured, and reasoned about. It covers programming languages, their syntax, semantics, type systems, and core concepts, along with major computational styles like functional, object-oriented, declarative, and reactive programming. This space captures both the practical mechanics of languages and the deeper models of thinking that shape how software is designed and expressed.
