Psychology plays a central role in UX design because products are built for humans, and the **Human Factor** must always take priority.  
Human factors describe the range of variables that people bring to a product.

## Common Human Factors that inform design

- Impatience
- Limited memory
- Needing analogies
- Limited concentration
- Changes in need
- Needing motivation
- Prejudices
- Fears
- Making errors
- Misjudgment

## Psychological models to help design for human factors

- **Mental Models** – internal maps users rely on to predict behavior
- **Feedback Loops** – outcomes users perceive at the end of a process

## Psychology principles that influence design

Principles captured from [Jon Yablonski](https://jonyablonski.com/) and his [Laws of UX](Laws-of-UX.md).

### Heuristic

- [Aesthetic-Usability Effect](/Aesthetic-Usability%20Effect) – attractive designs feel easier to use
- [Fitts' Law](/Fitts'%20Law) – speed depends on target size and distance
- [Goal Gradient Effect](/Goal%20Gradient%20Effect) – motivation rises as users near completion
- [Hick's Law](/Hick's%20Law) – more choices = slower decisions
- [Jakob's Law](/Jakob's%20Law) – users expect familiarity across sites
- [Miller's Law](/Miller's%20Law) – working memory holds about 7 ± 2 items
- [Parkinson's Law](/Parkinson's%20Law) – tasks expand to fill available time

### Principle

- [Doherty Threshold](/Doherty%20Threshold) – interaction feels smooth under 400ms response
- [Occam's Razor](/Occam's%20Razor) – the simplest valid solution is best
- [Pareto Principle](/Pareto%20Principle) – 80% of results often come from 20% of causes
- [Postel's Law](/Postel's%20Law) – accept broadly, output conservatively
- [Tesler's Law](/Tesler's%20Law) – complexity cannot be removed, only shifted

### Gestalt Principles

Gestalt = “shape” (German). Explains how humans group, pattern, and simplify perception.

- [Law of Common Region](/Law%20of%20Common%20Region) – shared boundaries group elements
- [Law of Proximity](/Law%20of%20Proximity) – nearby objects are seen as related
- [Law of Prägnanz](/Law%20of%20Pr%C3%A4gnanz) – people choose the simplest interpretation
- [Law of Similarity](/Law%20of%20Similarity) – similar elements are seen as a whole
- [Law of Uniform Connectedness](/Law%20of%20Uniform%20Connectedness) – connected items feel more related

### Cognitive Bias

- [Peak-End Rule](/Peak-End%20Rule) – memory is shaped by peaks and endings
- [Serial Position Effect](/Serial%20Position%20Effect) – first and last items remembered best
- [Von Restorff Effect](/Von%20Restorff%20Effect) – distinct items stand out and are recalled
- [Zeigarnik Effect](/Zeigarnik%20Effect) – unfinished tasks stick in memory


# Significance of Psychology in UX Design
It is pretty imperative that psychology plays a major role in UX design and must consider the human factor above everything else. The term **Human Factor** describes the range of variables that humans bring to the product. 

## Common Human Factors that inform design
- Impatience
- Limited memory
- Needing analogies
- Limited concentration
- Changes in need
- Needing motivation
- Prejudices
- Fears
- Making errors
- Misjudgment

# Psychological models to help design for human factors
1. **Mental Models** - Mental models are internal maps that allow humans to predict how something will work.
2. **Feedback Loops** - The outcome a user gets at the end of a process.

# Psychology principles that influence design
The following principles are captured from [Jon Yablonksi](https://jonyablonski.com/)'s work on [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/). To learn more read the book [Laws of UX](Laws-of-UX.md)

## Heuristic
1. **Aesthetic-Usability Effect** - Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable.
2. **Fitts' Law** - The time to acquire a target is a function of distance to and the size of the target.
3. **Goal Gradient Effect** - The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
4. **Hick's Law** - The time taken to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
5. **Jakob's Law** - Users spend most of the time on other sites and thus expect your site to work the same.
6. **Miller's Law** - An average person can keep only 7 (plus or minus 2 items) in their working memory.
7. **Parkinson's Law** - Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent. ^parkinsons-Law

Principle
8. **Doherty Threshold** - Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace of (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.
9. **Occam's Razor** - Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
10. **Pareto Principle** - For many events roughly 80% of the results come from 20% of the causes.
11. **Postel's Law** - Be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you send.
12. **Tesler's Law** - Also known as the **law of conservation of complexity**, it states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced.

Gestalt Principles
Gestalt principles state how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. the word **gestalt** is of German origin and it means shape.

13. **Law of Common Region** - Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
14. **Law of Proximity** - Objects that are near or proximate to each other tend to be grouped together.
15. **Law of # Prägnanz** - People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it the the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
16. **Law of Similarity** - The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape or group even if those elements are separated.
17. **Law of Uniform Connectedness** - Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.

Learn more about Gestalt Principles, through this [article from User Testing](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles) that describes additional Gestalt Principles and this [article from UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/psychology-design-4-gestalt-principles-to-use-as-your-next-design-solution-fcdec423a6bf) with examples of the Gestalt Principles in wireframes.

Cognitive Bias
18. **Peak-End Rule** - People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and its end, rather than the sum or average of every moment of the experience.
19. **Serial Position Effect** - Users have a propensity to remember the first and last items in a series.
20. **Von Restorff Effect** - Also known as the **Isolation Effect**. it predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
21. **Zeigarnik Effect** - People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
